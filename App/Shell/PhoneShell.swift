/// Downloads tabs, a now-playing `MiniPlayerBar` in the bottom accessory (sits above the tab bar,
/// shares its glass), and `.onScrollDown` tab-bar minimization. For Task 6 the tab contents are
/// placeholders except Library, which wires the existing library browser so a book can be played
/// and the mini-bar exercised.
///
/// The Library tab's browse state (`libraries`/`selectedLibraryID`/`browseMode`) lives HERE, on
/// `PhoneShell`, and is threaded into `LibraryTabContent` as bindings — not owned as `@State`
/// directly on `LibraryTabContent`. This is a deliberate, empirically-forced workaround (M1c-a
/// Task 9): `LibraryTabContent` sits inside the Library tab's `NavigationStack` and swaps its root
/// content by a local `browseMode` switch (Grid/Series/Authors). Popping a pushed `AuthorDetailView`/
/// `SeriesDetailView` back to that root was observed (via `os.Logger` instrumentation reproduced
/// live on-device) to tear down and remount `LibraryTabContent` from scratch — its `.task(id:)`
/// restarts even though `AppState.activeConnectionID` never changed, silently resetting
/// `browseMode` to `.grid` and dropping the user right back on the Grid instead of the Series/
/// Authors mode they were browsing. `PhoneShell.body`, confirmed via the same instrumentation,
/// evaluates exactly ONCE across this whole navigation — so state owned here (`@State`, not a
/// child's) survives the child's remount untouched, and `LibraryTabContent`'s `.task` guards its
/// one-time reset on an explicit `initializedConnectionID` marker (also hoisted here) rather than
